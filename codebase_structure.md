# Codebase Structure

These are the folders and some key files used to generate and store various unified blackhole files.

## Data folders

There are two facets of the blackhole files generated by
[/updateBlackholeFile.py](https://github.com/khulnasoft/blackhole/blob/master/updateBlackholeFile.py):

### Basic blackhole

Basic blackhole are domains that purvey advertising, malware, tracking, coin
mining and other abominable behavior. These blackhole are included in all our products.

The [/data](https://github.com/khulnasoft/blackhole/tree/master/data) folder holds the
metadata and latest blackhole for all our basic blackhole sources. The blackhole are updated
automatically by `/updateBlackholeFile.py` which iterates all the subfolders within `./data`.

### Optional blackhole extensions

Blackhole extensions include domains that push potentially addictive content like `porn`, `fake news`,
`gambling`, and `social` media.

The [/extensions](https://github.com/khulnasoft/blackhole/tree/master/extensions) folder holds
metadata and latest blackhole for all our basic blackhole sources. The blackhole are updated
automatically by `/updateBlackholeFile.py` which iterates all the subfolders within `./extensions`.

## Product folders

### Basic blackhole

The [basic blackhole file](https://github.com/khulnasoft/blackhole/blob/master/blackhole), containing
just adware, malware, etc, is stored in the root folder of this repository.

The [/blackhole/alternates](https://github.com/khulnasoft/blackhole/tree/master/alternates) this folder
contains the products of `updateBlackholeFile.py`, one subfolder for each permutation of
`fakenews`, `gambling`, `porn`, and `social` media blackhole, all of which include the base extensions
containing blackhole that block adware, malware, tracking, etc.

## Other notable files

- [./readme_template.md](https://github.com/khulnasoft/blackhole/blob/master/readme_template.md):
  This file is used to generate all the various readme files in this repository. Therefore,
